# Computer Keyboard for Lecroy Function Generator

This is a little thing I made for fun. It sets the output of Lecroy function generator based off of keyboard inputs.


Have no idea if it will work since I haven't played with the hardware. This sets up two "keyboards" on your keys; currently "qwerasdfzxvc" and "uiopjkl;m,./" with the left and right shift acting as octave pedals. The left keyboard drives channel 1 and the right keyboard channel 2.
